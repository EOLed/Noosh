As of now there are 5 players (in my book) who can win it KD, Lebron, Kawhi, Harden and Westbrook. All 5 have their pros/cons when it comes to voting and therefore the votes will get distributed very equally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take a closer look at their individual cases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harden&lt;/strong&gt; 27.7 PPG / 11.9 APG / 7.8 RPG / 1.3 STLPG [61% TS%] (3rd seed west)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His stats are out of this world and his offensive efficiency is amongst the greatest of all time. Houston&amp;#39;s record is surprisingly good and they&amp;#39;re winning way more games than anyone thought. Their record is not top 2 though (which it needs to be historically) and Harden&amp;#39;s lack of defense could hurt him again, just like it did last year when he didn&amp;#39;t even make the all NBA-3rd team, despite putting up great numbers. A long with the great stats comes some minuses like low DEF RTG, high usage rate, many TO&amp;#39;s and mediocre shooting% (respectable, but mediocre).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Durant&lt;/strong&gt; 26.1 PPG / 4.6 APG / 8.8 RPG / 1.2 STLPG / 1.6 BLKPG [65.1 TS%] (1st seed west)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Durant is having an amazing and very efficient season so far. His stats and his team record should arguable make him the ultimate MVP-candidate but as we all know he will get penalized for joining the warriors (like Lebron did in 2011). The system and the players around him makes him benefit so much that his efficiency is at a all-time high (59.4% eFG). I think he will miss out a lot of votes by joining an already all-time great team and not being the primary reason they&amp;#39;re great. No reward for taking the easy route.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Westbrook&lt;/strong&gt; 31.3 PPG / 10.6 APG / 10.5 RPG / 1.3 STLPG [54.4 TS%] (6th seed west) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man is averaging a triple-double for **** sake. His numbers are easily some of the greatest ever and he has managed to get a decent record so far. With that being said, and while many think that Westbrook will easily win the MVP, there are many downsides that could hurt him in the MVP race. First of all, his team record is too low. 6th seed atm, and so far they&amp;#39;ve benefited from the easy schedule and could potentially drop to 7th. Historically you want to be at 1st or 2nd seed, so this will hurt him (A LOT). Also his stats comes with a downside like Harden. Many turnovers, low efficiency and a usage rate that is the HIGHEST EVER people. I&amp;#39;m not trying to take anything away from Russ, but there is no denying that it is easier to produce outrageous stats when you have the ball over 40% of the time. People say he is stat padding, but as long as they&amp;#39;re winning when he gets triple doubles, it&amp;#39;s hard to argue against him so ima give him that. Just to summarize (I could talk about this all day) the amazing individual statline has a clear downside and he will get penalized heavily for this in the voting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lebron&lt;/strong&gt; 25.4 PPG / 8.6 APG / 7.9 RPG / 1.4 STLPG [59.3 TS%] (1st seed east) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where to start... Lebron is (still) the best player in world, he&amp;#39;s putting out great numbers and he&amp;#39;s leading his conference. We all know why Lebron is in the debate - no need to argue for that. The intersting thing is why he might miss out on votes. First of all he is surrounded by 2 other star players on a stacked Cleveland team that plays in a weaker conference. Voter-fatigue is also something we have to put in mind, as he already have 4 MVP&amp;#39;s and the NBA likes to award new players. He is in his last years of his prime and we can slowly see his MPG drop slightly, while he&amp;#39;s also resting entire games (3 so far) to stay sharp for playoffs. I have no doubt that if Lebron wants this MVP he can get it, and this might be his last shot for it. He is my personal favorite to win the MVP, but I think his resting will hurt him in the race. We all know ring&amp;gt;MVP in Lebron&amp;#39;s head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kawhi&lt;/strong&gt; 24.4 PPG / 3.1 APG / 6.0 RPG / 2.0 STLPG [60.8 TS%] (2nd seed west)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While his stats might not be mind-blowing there are many things we have to put in consideration. Kawhi is the greatest defender in the NBA and one of the all-time greats already at such a young age. He has steadily improved every year he has been in the NBA and he even stepped up his game from last year where he got 2nd in MVP-voting. Let me just say that again 2ND IN MVP VOTING. While his defensive ratings have dropped slightly this year because of Duncan&amp;#39;s retirement and teams playing 4on4 and therefore not allowing him to defend (you can find many articles about this)  we still know he has the ability to shut down any superstar. His efficiency is very high and he is now the new face of the franchise who could potentially get the 1st seed. While all these things are perfect for a new MVP-story, there are some things that will make him lose votes. His stats aren&amp;#39;t as great as the 4 players mentioned above, his usage rate is lower because of Pop&amp;#39;s system and he isn&amp;#39;t exactly the &amp;quot;Superstar-type&amp;quot; of player. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong he is a superstar, but he just isn&amp;#39;t getting the same amount of attention as&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; He is very lowkey, quiet and consistent. He doesn&amp;#39;t have many highlight-plays and he doesn&amp;#39;t put up triple-doubles or 50 point games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s impossible at this point to say whose to win it. Literally impossible, it&amp;#39;s so close there is no way to tell yet, but we know it will be one these five. Debate guys, what do you think should happen for one of these players to stand out. I find the fact that it&amp;#39;s so close very exciting, compared to last year when we all knew Curry would win it already at this point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;English second language; give some feedback, first time writing a post like this.. :) Happy new year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Added TS% as requested&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
